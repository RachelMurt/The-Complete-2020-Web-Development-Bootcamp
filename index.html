      italic only styles the text
      emphasise stresses the text
      for this reason we use emphasise instead of italics
      this is similar to the bold tag
      <b></b> instead we should use <<strong></strong>
      because of the same reasons
      for more information on strong vs bold

        the only difference between an ordered list and an unordered list,
        is that an ordered list will have its items ordered by number,
        whereas unordered lists will have just bullet points.
